# GeneaKit

A set of functions for pedigree analysis, designed for use with data from the [GÉNÉO portal](https://portailgeneo.ca). Based on the functionality of [GENLIB](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GENLIB/index.html): see the article by Gauvin et al. (2015) \<[doi:10.1186/s12859-015-0581-5](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-015-0581-5)>.

## Documentation

The [GENLIB reference manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GENLIB/GENLIB.pdf) and this README file are sufficient to learn how to use GeneaKit. In addition, documentation is available for all functions through the `help()` function, e.g. `help(gen.phi)`.

## Aims

* Easily port R code using GENLIB into Python code using GeneaKit;
* Integrate with Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy;
* Provide speed and convenience;
* Present a modular structure for further development.

## Functions

* Create a pedigree structure from a file or `DataFrame`;
* Output a pedigree as a `DataFrame`;
* Identify individuals in a pedigree, such as probands and founders;
* Extract a subpedigree from a pedigree;
* Describe a pedigree, such as the number of individuals and its completeness;
* Compute information about a pedigree, such as the pairwise kinship coefficients of probands and the genetic contributions of ancestors;
* (Eventually) Simulate information about pedigrees and individuals.

## System Requirements

This software was [tested with Python 3.9+](https://github.com/Genopop/geneakit/actions/workflows/tests.yml), used mainly on Linux 5.14.0 x64 (with GCC 12) and developed with Python 3.13.7 on macOS 26.0 ARM64 (with Clang 17.0.0). It was not tested on Windows, but in theory should be compatible with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Otherwise OpenMP may cause the compilation to fail.

## Installation

* Clone this repository, `cd` into it, then run `pip install .` while running a virtual Python environment. Alternatively, without cloning, run:
    ```
    pip install https://github.com/Genopop/geneakit/archive/main.zip
    ```
    Both options install two packages, `geneakit` and `cgeneakit` (used by the former internally), and their dependencies.

* If OpenMP is found during installation, the `geneakit.phi()` function will run in parallel. If you use macOS, you may need to follow [these instructions](https://www.scivision.dev/cmake-openmp/) to enable OpenMP.

* On a MacBook Air M3, it took about four seconds for the remote `pip install` to complete the installation.

## Data

* If the pedigree is loaded from a file, using `geneakit.genealogy("path/to/pedigree.csv")`, the file *must* start with an irrelevant line (such as `ind father mother sex`) and the following lines must contain, as digits, each individual's ID, their father's ID (`0` if unknown), their mother's ID (`0` if unknown), and their sex (`0` if unknown, `1` if male, `2` if female), in that order. Each information must be separated by anything but digits (tabs, spaces, commas, etc.), with one line per individual.

* Three datasets come from the GENLIB source code: `geneakit.geneaJi`, `geneakit.genea140`  and `geneakit.pop140`. They are part of the project for testing and practice. More information on these datasets is available in the [GENLIB reference manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GENLIB/GENLIB.pdf). They may be loaded using `geneakit.genealogy(geneakit.geneaJi)`, etc.

* You may also load the pedigree from a Pandas DataFrame, for instance:
```python
import geneakit as gen
import pandas as pd
inds = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
fathers = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 3, 3, 6, 6]
mothers = [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 4, 4, 5, 5]
sexes = [1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2]
df = pd.DataFrame({'ind': inds, 'father': fathers,
                   'mother': mothers, 'sex': sexes})
ped = gen.genealogy(df)
```

## Comparison with GENLIB

The function calls are almost verbatim copies of GENLIB's. For instance:

```r
# With GENLIB
library(GENLIB)
data(genea140)
ped <- gen.genealogy(genea140)
pro <- gen.pro(ped)
phi <- gen.phi(ped, pro=pro)
mean <- gen.phiMean(phi)
mrca <- gen.findMRCA(ped, c(802424, 868572))
dist <- gen.find.Min.Distance.MRCA(mrca)
out <- gen.genout(ped, sorted=TRUE)
```


```python
# With GeneaKit
import geneakit as gen
from geneakit import genea140
ped = gen.genealogy(genea140)
pro = gen.pro(ped)
phi = gen.phi(ped, pro=pro)
mean = gen.phiMean(phi)
mrca = gen.findMRCA(ped, [802424, 868572])
dist = gen.find_Min_Distance_MRCA(mrca)
out = gen.genout(ped, sorted=True)
```

## Demo

After the virtual Python environment is activated (e.g. with `source venv/bin/activate`), run the following commands.

```python
from time import time
import geneakit as gen # Import the package
from geneakit import genea140 # Locate the sample dataset
ped = gen.genealogy(genea140) # Load the genealogy
pro = gen.pro(ped) # Identify the probands
start = time()
phi = gen.phi(ped, pro=pro) # Compute all pairwise kinship coefficients between the probands
mean = gen.phiMean(phi) # Compute the mean kinship coefficient
end = time()
print(mean)
print(f"The computation took {end-start:.3f} seconds.")
```

The mean kinship coefficient should be 0.0011437357709631094.

On a MacBook Air M3, the computation took about 3 seconds. As a comparison, the equivalent computation in R takes about 3 minutes on the same computer.
